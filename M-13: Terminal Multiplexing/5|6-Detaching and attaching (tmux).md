# Challenge Description
Let's try the same thing with tmux!

tmux (terminal multiplexer) is screen's younger, more modern cousin. It does all the same things but with some different key bindings. The biggest difference? Instead of Ctrl-A, tmux uses Ctrl-B as its command prefix.

So to detach from tmux, you press Ctrl-B followed by d.
```bash
hacker@dojo:~$ tmux
[doing some work...]
[Press Ctrl-B, then d]
[detached (from session 0)]
hacker@dojo:~$ 
```
The commands also differ:

  - tmux ls - List sessions
  - tmux attach or tmux a - Reattach to session

For this challenge:

  1. Launch tmux
  2. Detach from it.
  3. Run /challenge/run (this will send the flag to your detached session!)
  4. Reattach to see your prize
