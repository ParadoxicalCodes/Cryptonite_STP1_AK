# Challenge Description
In addition to adding and removing permissions, as in the previous level, chmod can also simply set permissions altogether, overwriting the old ones. This is done by using = instead of - or +. For example:

  1. u=rw sets read and write permissions for the user, and wipes the execute permission
  2. o=x sets only executable permissions for the world, wiping read and write
  3. a=rwx sets read, write, and executable permissions for the user, group, and world!

But what if you want to change user permissions in a different way as group permissions? Say, you want to set rw for the owning user, but only r for the owning group? You can achieve this by chaining multiple modes to chmod with ,!

  1. chmod u=rw,g=r /challenge/pwn will set the user permissions to read and write, and the group permissions to read-only
  2. chmod a=r,u=rw /challenge/pwn will set the user permissions to read and write, and the group and world permissions to read-only

Additionally, you can zero out permissions with -:

  1. chmod u=rw,g=r,o=- /challenge/pwn will set the user permissions to read and write, the group permissions to read-only, and the world permissions to nothing at all

Keep in mind, that -, appearing after = is in a different context than if it appeared directly after the u, g, or o (in which case, it would cause specific bits to be removed, not everything).

This level extends the previous level by requesting more radical permission changes, which you will need = and ,-chaining to achieve. Good luck!
