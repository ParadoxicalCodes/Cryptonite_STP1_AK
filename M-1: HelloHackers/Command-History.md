# Challenge Description
You're going to type a lot of commands, and typing everything from scratch can be annoying. Luckily, the shell saves a history of every command you invoke.

You can scroll through those saved commands with the up/down arrow keys, and we'll practice that in this challenge. This challenge will inject the flag into your history. Bring up a terminal, hit the up arrow, and grab it! In other challenges, the history will contain the log of the commands you've run, so if you need to run a similar command again, you can use the arrow keys to scroll through and find it!
# Thought Process & Solution
Just had to press Up key once and we can see the flag in our terminal.
```Bash
hacker@hello~command-history:~$ the flag is pwn.college{YQ-c3-21MyxDntNMyFpDi9u1PMx.QX2MTM3EDL5EzN0czW}
```
**Flag:** `pwn.college{YQ-c3-21MyxDntNMyFpDi9u1PMx.QX2MTM3EDL5EzN0czW}`
