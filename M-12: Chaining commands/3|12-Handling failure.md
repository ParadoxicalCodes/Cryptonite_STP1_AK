# Challenge Description
You just learned about the && operator, which runs the second command only if the first succeeds. Now let's learn about its opposite: the || operator allows you to run a second command only if the first command fails (exits with a non-zero code). This is called the "OR" operator because either the first command succeeds OR the second command will run.

Here's the syntax:
```bash
hacker@dojo:~$ command1 || command2
```
This means: "Run command1, and IF it fails, then run command2."

Some examples:
```bash
hacker@dojo:~$ touch /file || echo "touch failed, so this runs"
touch: cannot touch '/file': Permission denied
touch failed, so this runs
hacker@dojo:~$ touch /home/hacker/file || echo "this will NOT run"
hacker@dojo:~$
```
The || operator is super useful for providing fallback commands or error handling!

In this challenge, you need to chain /challenge/first-failure and /challenge/second using the || operator. Go for it!
