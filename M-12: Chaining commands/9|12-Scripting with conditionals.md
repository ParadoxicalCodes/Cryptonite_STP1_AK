# Challenge Description
Now that you can use arguments in scripts, let's make them smarter with conditional logic!

In bash, you can use if statements to make decisions:
```bash
if [ "$1" == "ping" ]
then
    echo "pong"
fi
```
The above, in English, is if the first argument is "ping", print out "pong". The syntax is somewhat unforgiving for a few reasons. First, you must have spaces after if (if you're used to a language like C, this is different), after [, and before ]. Second, if, then, and fi must all be on different lines (or separated by semicolons); you can't lump them into the same statement. It's also a bit weird: instead of endif or end or something like that, the terminator of the if statement is fi (if backwards). Just something you have to remember.

For this challenge, write a script at /home/hacker/solve.sh that:

  Takes one argument
  If the argument is "pwn", output "college"
  For any other input, output nothing

Example:
```baah
hacker@dojo:~$ bash /home/hacker/solve.sh pwn
college
hacker@dojo:~$ bash /home/hacker/solve.sh foo
hacker@dojo:~$
```
Once your script works correctly, run /challenge/run to get your flag!
