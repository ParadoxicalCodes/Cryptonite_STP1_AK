# Challenge Description
With no arguments, su will start a root shell (after authenticating with root's password). However, you can also give a username as an argument to switch to that user instead of root. For example:
```bash
hacker@dojo:~$ su some-user
Password:
some-user@dojo:~$
```
Awesome! In this level, you must switch to the zardus user and then run /challenge/run. Zardus' password is dont-hack-me. Good luck!
