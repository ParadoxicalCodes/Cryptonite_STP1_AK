# Challenge Description
In the course of working with the shell, you will often want to store the output of some command into a variable. Luckily, the shell makes this quite easy using something called Command Substitution! Observe:
```bash
hacker@dojo:~$ FLAG=$(cat /flag)
hacker@dojo:~$ echo "$FLAG"
pwn.college{blahblahblah}
hacker@dojo:~$
```
Neat! Now, you practice. Read the output of the /challenge/run command directly into a variable called PWN, and it will contain the flag!
# Thought Process & Solution

```bash

```
**Flag:** `pwn.college{}`
