# Challenge Description
Bypassing the second chamber leads to an empty floor except for a single artifact in the center: an old MP3 player, scratched and worn. On its surface, a cipher is etched, a message left behind for anyone who can decode it

`twj eys zpr ukm 'viamnwqw' bx lzgo: esmqqui{yyr_oshwwcm_bwupa}`

When you power it on, the sound fills the chamber. The tracks play like whispers from a lost world, and you recognize it as a song from Panchikoâ€™s latest studio album, particularly track no. 8. Its title feels familiar, hinting at a famous cipher. Decrypt it by using the album name as your key and continue your ascent.
# Thought Process & Solution
Description seemed to be hinting at a vignere cipher with album name as the key. From google search we see Panchiko's latest album is titled "Ginkgo". So I put that as a key which on deciphering leads to this

`now use the key "panchiko" on flag:`

`rigckmv{osd_ikumqog_tjkjm}`

So putting ginkgo as key to the new cipher gives us the flag.

**Flag:** `citadel{add_vinegar_twice}`
