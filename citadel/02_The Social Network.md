# Challenge Description
ðŸ—¼OSINT pt1: The ascent begins. The first floor is not metal or binaries but of memory. Among the echoes, one voice lingers, of an early climber. He was among the earliest to challenge the Citadel, and though he failed, his traces remain scattered across the ruins of the old world.

It is said that the key to the next floor can be found by tracing the socials of this legendary climber.

# Thought Process & Solution
As the challenge says I open the instagram page of [citadweller](https://www.instagram.com/citadweller/).

As we can see just 1 story - click on it and it gives me a part of the flag and prompts me to open it's twitter page with the same username.

And the second part of the flag is right there.
