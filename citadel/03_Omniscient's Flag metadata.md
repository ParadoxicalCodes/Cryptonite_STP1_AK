# Challenge Description
As you step into the second chamber, a figure manifests before you. Before you stands a forgotten deity, a dead god spoken of only in whispers. Known by countless names: “Apostle of Epilogue and Eternity,” “Lone Messiah” and many more lost to time.

They leave nothing but a single image, a relic carrying his final secret. Hidden within its layers lies the key to ascend to the next chamber.
# Thought Process & Solution
So we are given an image and from the challenge title it seems to be about metadate so i immediately check for its metadata.

And we come across this in the results

<img width="1293" height="173" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/75479e00-98ab-4306-8eb1-fa69d7a45ef6" />

This means there is a file hidden inside our challenge.jpg So i binwalk our file for hidden data.
